// Extend the User Story 7 to utilize advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts
// such as the Collections Framework to manage character patterns in a more flexible
// and efficient manner. The application retrieves and displays the "OOPS" banner
// using these mappings.

// Key Requirements:
// 1. Use HashMap to store ASCII art patterns for characters
// 2. Create methods to generate and retrieve character patterns
// 3. Retrieve and display patterns for the message "OOPS"
// 4. Implement modular and reusable character pattern system
// 5. Utilize Collections Framework for pattern management
